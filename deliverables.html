                <p>Simple workflow that uses the google api to update a google sheet and return all rows.</p>
                <p>There is not much to write about this as it is triggered by another workflow, 
                    calls the google api to write the name given by the parent workflow and then adds
                    that name to the sheet along with a timestamp. Finally it retrieves all rows from the sheet
                    and returns them to the parent workflow.

                <p>There were some challenges with setting up this workflow as it was my first
                    time using the google cloud console and n8n so there was definetly a learning curve
                    to get started. Once I got familiarized with the google dashboard I didn't have any issues,
                    but the first two to three times I had to setup the credentials I had to rewatch the tutorial.

                    This workflow is very very similar to the deliverable shown above with one difference,
                    instead of updating the google sheet with just a name, it now updates the sheet with 
                    a name, the origin of that name provided by chatgpt, and a timestamp.

                    The learning curve was much gentler for this workflow as n8n is a tool that is designed to 
                    work with AI agents calling LLMs so while setting up an openAI account was new, it was a lot
                    simpler than setting up the google cloud console.

                    Retrieve and Generate (RAG) is a technique that allows LLMs to access data/databases
                    that contain information that they would either not be well versed in or have access to.
                    This RAG bot is setup to access the previous two deliverables and answer questions about the data
                    that is stored in the google sheets. There are actually two workflows in this deliverable,
                    one that will update the vector store with new data when the worksheets are changed and another
                    that is an AI agent with access to the vector store that can answer questions about the data.

                    Honestly one of the more painles deliverables. Pinecone is super easy to setup an account with, 
                    but I did run into some issues with mismatched embedding models and not understanding how 
                    the dimensons of the vector store factored into data processing speed.

                    This was originally going to be a whatsapp bot, but when I tried to make a meta 
                    developer account I would get to the part where they ask for a phone number to verify 
                    and I always got an error saying to try again later. After some googling I found that 
                    it should have been possible to add my phone number to the linked facebook account, but 
                    that of course also did not work. So I switched to telegram which the way that API keys 
                    are distributed was a bit strange it was simple.

                    This is how I was calling the n8n workflows throughout this demo page. It was 
                    great learning about how webhooks work and how data is sent throughout the internet 
                    from service to service. The error alert part of this workflow is not that complicated
                    it triggers anytime an error in the workspace occurs and then sends me a telegram 
                    alert with the error message and stack trace.s

                    The webhooks required a bit of learning, but no too much and once I understood them 
                    it was super easy to send small bits of data through them. There were no challenges with
                    setting up the error handling alert, n8n made it super simple to do so.

                    A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is just a way to allow LLMs to access not just 
                    external data from things like vector stores and data bases, it allows them access to
                    API calls that can control whatever you give them access to. This is not what I see as
                    a good use of AI and I also just do not want an LLM to be able to send emails for me, but 
                    it is super useful as you do not need to format the system prompt to inform the LLM of
                    what tools it has at its disposal the MCP server handles that for you.

                    I had no challenges using this within n8n, but Sam said that he was unable to connect it 
                    to Claude, I am not going to give an LLM that much control over my accounts so I did not 
                    even try and setup that feature.

                    It is not really hard to see the business applicability of n8n workflows. 
                    They are not too difficult to set up, run with very little maintenance, 
                    and are capable of transferring data from api to api. The last part is 
                    what makes n8n so useful for businesses as it does not limit you to a single 
                    service or ecosystem the way that Microsoft or Google may try and do. I am 
                    sure that there are many other general reasons that n8n can be utilized 
                    effectively, but when it comes to our application of n8n, automating tech 
                    support, it is a game changer. First it should be easy to fit into existing 
                    IT systems with a fair bit of retooling for whatever database is being used, 
                    secondly it will be able to reduce the amount of simple tickets that IT 
                    departments see a lot of, and finally our workflow will be able to fact 
                    check itself, to a degree. 
                    <br></br>
                    The workflow would need to be changed quite a bit depending if you were 
                    trying to implement it into an already existing IT system, such as 
                    footprints, but it would not require a foundational change to how it 
                    actually works more so just a number of changes to the api calls and 
                    the fields that are passed from node to node. For the amount of work 
                    that this workflow is able to cut down on it would be worth it.
                </p>

            <div class="column">
                <p>
                    This workflow is designed to not outright replace someone working 
                    an IT service job as I believe that fully automated customer 
                    support is, to put it kindly, a silly idea that just makes 
                    customers more frustrated before they are able to speak 
                    with a human. The way that we minimize the frustration of AI 
                    customer support is by only having the first, and most basic 
                    troubleshooting steps be automated and by checking the 
                    response for reliability. These cut down on the frustrations 
                    that I have with automated customer support systems which is 
                    a lack of connection and questionable information.
                    <br></br>
                    With the two factors I have fully described and the third that 
                    I touched on it is not hard to see that this workflow will be 
                    simple to implement, bring minimal disruption to already 
                    existing employee workflows, and give human support more 
                    time to assist with more complex, and involved tickets.

                <p>
                    For security most of how our application is 
                    set up raises no concerns as the account creation 
                    and authorization is handled by Supabase which 
                    is secure, and to access the actual workflows a 
                    person needs to sign into Sam’s Hostinger account
                    and then on that n8n instance they need to sign 
                    into Sam’s n8n 
                    account. This does not mean that there aren’t any 
                    concerns, there are concerns about the data that 
                    is collected and processed by the AI agents as 
                    well as licensing the workflow. The data that the 
                    AI can collect from our main application is limited 
                    as it is only able to see the first message and 
                    (fully anecdotal) as a general rule IT clients 
                    take a few more messages than that to accidentally 
                    provide sensitive information, but there are exceptions 
                    when the end user does not know that what they 
                    are giving is sensitive information, like a 95 
                    number here at UVM. To keep this from happening 
                    we could simply reroute any data that contains 
                    something that seems to be sensitive (95#, SSN, etc.) 
                    around the AI agents. 
                    <br></br>
                    As for licensing issues it’s a bit simpler if UVM 
                    or more specifically ETS asked us to help them to 
                    implement this workflow into footprints that would 
                    be no issue under n8n’s sustainable use license, but 
                    if we made this workflow and asked ETS if they would 
                    buy it off of us for x amount then that would be 
                    explicitly against the n8n license.
